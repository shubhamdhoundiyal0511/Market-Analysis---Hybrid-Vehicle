# Market-Analysis---Hybrid-Vehicle
Chi-Square Test:
The Chi-Square Test was conducted to examine the relationship between categorical variables, such as vehicle ownership patterns and locations. Observed and expected frequencies were compared to determine if the differences were statistically significant.

T-Test:
T-tests were applied to compare the means of various features (e.g., speed, affordability, energy efficiency) of hybrid cars across different cities. The test helped evaluate if the differences in perceptions or preferences among locations were significant.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):
ANOVA was used to assess whether there are significant differences in key metrics (e.g., income levels or preferences) across multiple groups. This analysis identified variations and provided insights into segment-specific trends.

Correlation Analysis:
Correlation analysis measured the relationships between key attributes of hybrid vehicles, such as energy efficiency, maintenance cost, and customer satisfaction metrics. This helped identify strongly correlated factors influencing customer preferences.

Regression Analysis:
Regression techniques were employed (likely from related datasets or sheets not explicitly labeled here) to model the relationship between independent variables (e.g., vehicle attributes) and dependent outcomes, such as purchase intention or satisfaction.
